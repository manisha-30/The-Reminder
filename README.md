**Water Reminder App**

 Designed a project dedicated to promoting a healthy lifestyle by implementing regular hydration reminders. This project
adopts a particular strategy, leveraging user-specific parameters such as gender and weight to compute daily water intake
recommendations. Tailored reminders are synchronized with individual wake-up and sleep schedules, ensuring timely
prompts for hydration throughout the day. Additionally, the project allows user to manually update their water consumption
data and provides visual insights through integrated charts to monitor hydration trends.
The go-to repo for fun, cool and unique web developer projects.
